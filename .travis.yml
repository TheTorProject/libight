    # Autotools builds
    # ----------------
    #
    # We need to keep at least one build using autotools to make sure
    # building with autotools is not broken. The blocker to migrate from
    # autotools to CMake build is that currently we're not able to
    # compile for Msys, Android, and iOS using CMake.
    #
    # Another blocker is that updating the clang build to our custom
    # Debian Docker image did not work immediately out of the box, so
    # we have deferred a bit converting up clang to CMake.
    #
    # Only using `-Werror` for CXXFLAGS because using it for CFLAGS
    # prevents the `./configure` script from running (see #1318).

# Simplified build system

This directory contains the simplified build system. You can use this to
compile the following pieces of source code:

- `geoip`: [geoip](https://github.com/maxmind/geoip-api-c)
- `libressl`: [libressl](https://github.com/libressl-portable)
- `libevent`: [libevent](https://github.com/libevent/libevent)
- `c-ares`: [c-ares](https://github.com/c-ares/c-ares)
- `mk`: Measurement Kit itself

If needed, the build system will fetch the required sources and possibly
apply patches. In such case, sources will live in

```
./MK_BUILD/<os>/<arch>/<package>/<package-sources-dir>/
```

Artifacts are in

```
./MK_DIST/<os>/<arch>/<package>/
```

Paths are relative to the top level directory of MK sources.

If a package needs another package, you need to compile that other package
first (or to populate appropriately `./MK_DIST/<os>/<arch>/>package>/` using
the artifacts generated by a previous build).

All the scripts except `build.bat` can actually be called from everywhere.

## Build on Linux / macOS

Just call the script named after the package to build. E.g.:

```
./script/build/libressl
```

## Cross compile for iOS

We assume that you have a macOS system with Xcode installed and the command
line developer tools installed.

```
./script/build/cross-ios <os> <arch> ./script/build/<package>
```

To see available `<os>` and `<arch>` values, run `cross-ios` without arguments.

## Cross compile for Android

We assume that you have the NDK installed. Create a standalone Android toolchain
using the `android-toolchain` script:

```
./script/build/android-toolchain <ndk-bundle-path> <arch>
```

Run the script without arguments to see all the available `<arch>` options.
The toolchain will be created in:

```
./MK_BUILD/android/toolchain/<arch>/
```

Then cross compile using:

```
./script/build/cross-android <arch> ./script/build/<package>
```

## Compile for Windows

We assume that:

1. you have installed Visual Studio 2017 Community

2. you have installed CMake and opted to have `cmake.exe` inside your path
   during the install process (important!)

3. you have installed Ubuntu and `ubuntu.exe` is available from your
   developer command prompt (that should be the case)

4. you are typing inside the x32 or x64 Developer Command prompt

5. you `chdir`-ed into the top-level directory of MK sources

```
cd script\build
build.bat <package>
```

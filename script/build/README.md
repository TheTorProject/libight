# Simplified build system

This directory contains the simplified build system. You can use this to
compile MK or its dependencies.

If needed, the build system will fetch the required sources and possibly
apply patches. In such case, sources will live in

```
./MK_BUILD/<os>/<arch>/<package>/<package-sources-dir>/
```

Artifacts are in

```
./MK_DIST/<os>/<arch>/<package>/
```

Paths are relative to the top level directory of MK sources.

If a package needs another package, you need to compile that other package
first (or to populate appropriately `./MK_DIST/<os>/<arch>/>package>/` using
the artifacts generated by a previous build).

## Build on Linux / macOS

Just call the script named after the dependency. E.g.:

```
./script/build/libressl
```

You can actually call these scripts from anywhere.

## Cross compile for iOS

We assume that you have a macOS system with Xcode installed and the command
line developer tools installed.

```
./script/build/cross-ios <os> <arch> ./script/build/<package>
```

To see available `<os>` and `<arch>` values, run `cross-ios` without arguments.

## Cross compile for Android

We assume that you have the NDK installed. Create a standalone Android toolchain
using the `android-toolchain` script:

```
./script/build/android-toolchain <ndk-bundle-path> <arch>
```

Run the script without arguments to see all the available `<arch>` options.
The toolchain will be created in:

```
./MK_BUILD/android/toolchain/<arch>/
```

Then cross compile using:

```
./script/build/cross-android <arch> ./script/build/<package>
```

## Compile for Windows

We assume that:

1. you have installed Visual Studio 2017 Community

2. you have installed CMake and opted to have `cmake.exe` inside your path
   during the install process (important!)

3. you have installed Ubuntu and `ubuntu.exe` is available from your
   developer command prompt (that should be the case)

4. you are typing commands from the Developer Command prompt specific of
   the architecture that you want to build for (i.e. x32 or x64)

5. you are inside the top-level directory of MK sources

```
cd script\build
build.bat <package>
```

 * Note: this API is generic enough that we may want to use part of it
 * to re-implement also parts of the Android traceroute code.
 *
 * In general, this API has very little to do with DNS and is more a
 * UDP thing that can be useful to any piece of code that sends a UDP
 * packet and waits for a response. So, perhaps, we may want to move
 * at least the engine of it in `measurement_kit/net`. I'd do that
 * when we need to share it, however, rather than doing it now.

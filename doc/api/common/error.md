# DESCRIPTION

`Error` represents an error that occurred. It is a derived class of `std::exception` such that one can throw `Errors` and more generally catch all `std::exception`. (In general in measurement-kit we would rather pass error to callbacks than throw, but there are also some cases where throwing makes sense.) 

An error is uniquely identified by the error code that it wraps. By popular convention, the `0` error code indicates no error. 

In addition to the error code, there is also a reason string that indicates the error that occurred in a more human friendly way. The reason strings are compatible with the failure strings [specified by OONI](https://github.com/TheTorProject/ooni-spec/blob/master/data-formats/df-000-base.md#error-strings). 

Error codes may change from one version of measurement-kit to the following one. Reason strings instead should not change unless that is required to track OONI's specification. 

The reason string corresponding to no error is an empty string. 

If there is no reason string corresponding to a specific error code, the default reason string `unknown_error ${code}` is generated. 

An error can contain child errors. This is handy when representing the result of a parallel operation where only certain sub-operations may fail. 

As of measurement-kit v0.8.0, too many errors are defined. We will try to cut down the total number of errors to around 50. 

Error appeared in measurement-kit v0.1.0. `MK_DEFINE_ERR` was added in measurement-kit v0.2.0. Between v0.2.0 and v0.7.0 (excluded) we also had the `ErrorContext` class. The Error has been further reworked as part of measurement-kit v0.8.0 as part of a refactoring of common.

The default constructor initializes the error code to zero.

The constructor with error initializes the error code to the specified error code.

The constructor with error and reason string initializes both.

The constructor with error code, reason string, and child error also initializes the child error.

The bool operator evaluates to true if the error code is nonzero.

The equality with error code operator compares the error's error code with the specified error code.

The equality with error code compares the error codes for equality.

The unequality with error code operator compares the error's error code with the specified error code.

The unequality with error compares the error codes for unquality.

`what` returns the reason string.

`add_child_error` allows you tou append additional child errors.

`child_errors` contains all the child errors.

`code` contains the error code.

`reason` contains the reason string.

`MK_DEFINE_ERR` allows you to quickly define a class derived from Error.

`NoError` represents the absence of errors.

`GenericError` represents all the errors that we don't bother to map more specifically.

`NotInitializedError` is used when a variable that should have been initialized was not.

`ValueError` is used whenever the provided input is invalid.

`MockedError` should only be used in regress tests to indicate that a specific API failed with a mocked error. This is used to make sure that the returned error was actually correctly mocked.

`JsonParseError` indicates that we could not parse a JSON.

`JsonKeyError` indicates that a specific key does not exists in a JSON.

`JsonDomainError` indicates that we are using a JSON of a specific type assuming that it is of another type. For example, the JSON may be `null` and we may be trying to using it like a map from string to string, which obviously is not possible.

`FileEofError` indicates that we hit premature EOF when reading a file.

`FileIoError` indicates I/O error when reading a file.

`ParallelOperationError` indicates that a parallel operation failed. In this case, consult the child errors to see more details.

`SequentialOperationError` indicates that a sequential operation has failed. See the child errors for more details.

`IllegalSequenceError` indicates an illegal UTF-8 sequence.

`UnexpectedNullByteError` indicates an unexpected null byte in a UTF-8 stream.

`IncompleteUtf8SequenceError` indicates an unexpected UTF-8 sequence.

`NotImplementedError` indicates that an operation is not implemented.

`TimeoutError` indicates that a timeout occurred.

`JsonProcessingError` indicates an error processing a JSON.

`MK_ERR_NET` takes a relative error code and returns an error code inside of the error codes space reserved for the net sub-library.

`MK_ERR_DNS` is like MK_ERR_NET but for dns.

`MK_ERR_HTTP` is like MK_ERR_NET but for http.

`MK_ERR_TRACEROUTE` is like MK_ERR_NET but for traceroute.

`MK_ERR_MLABNS` is like MK_ERR_NET but for mlabns.

`MK_ERR_OONI` is like MK_ERR_NET but for ooni.

`MK_ERR_REPORT` is like MK_ERR_NET but for report.

`MK_ERR_NDT` is like MK_ERR_NET but for ndt.

`std::operator<<`'s override allows to print errors as their reason string.

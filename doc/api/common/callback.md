# NAME

`measurement_kit/common/callback.hpp`

# LIBRARY

measurement-kit (`libmeasurement_kit`, `-lmeasurement_kit`)

# SYNOPSIS

```C++
#ifndef MEASUREMENT_KIT_COMMON_CALLBACK_HPP
#define MEASUREMENT_KIT_COMMON_CALLBACK_HPP

namespace mk {

template <typename... T> using Callback = std::function<void(T...)>;

} // namespace mk
#endif
```

# DESCRIPTION

`Callback` is syntactic sugar for writing callback functions. In general, we try to use `Callback` in the code to name functions that will be called _after_ the function to which they have been passed has returned. That is, the function is supposed to schedule their deferred execution but should not execute it directly. 

Available since measurement-kit v0.2.0.

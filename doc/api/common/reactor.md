# NAME
Reactor -- Dispatcher of I/O events

# LIBRARY
MeasurementKit (libmeasurement_kit, -lmeasurement_kit).

# SYNOPSIS
```C++
#include <measurement_kit/common.hpp>

mk::Poller poller;
event_base *p = poller.get_event_base();
evdns_base *dp = poller.get_evdns_base();

poller.loop();                    // Blocking method to run the event loop
poller.break_loop();              // Break out of event loop
poller.loop_once();               // Just one iteration of event loop

// Functions to work with the DNS server addresses
// They are especially useful in mobile applications where typically
// we do not have /etc/resolv.conf and hence by default no name-server
// is configured and name resolution does not work at all
if (poller.count_nameservers() <= 0) {
    poller.add_nameserver("8.8.8.8");        // Leaving the port implied
    poller.add_nameserver("8.8.4.4:53");     // Also with port
}

// Schedule a call to run in the next I/O cycle
poller.call_soon([objects]() {
    // Do something with `objects`
});

// Schedule a call 3.14 seconds in the future
poller.call_later(3.14, [objects]() {
    // Do something with `objects`
});

mk::Poller *root = mk::Poller::global();
```

# DESCRIPTION

The `Poller` object dispatches I/O events. Most MeasurementKit objects
refer to a `Poller` object (be it a specific poller or the global poller).

Generally, you setup some objects making sure they refer to a poller and
then you invoke that poller's `loop()` method. Until you're satisfied and
you exit from the event loop using the `break_loop()` method.

This is the standard way of doing things in single-threaded programs. See
the documentation of `Async` to see how to run measurements in a background
thread (which is what you typically want for apps).

# HISTORY

The `Poller` class appeared in MeasurementKit 0.1.0.

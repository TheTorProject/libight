# Documentation

Many folders in this repository have a `README.md` file that document
in detail the content of such folder.

For documenting our public headers, we use [Doxygen](
http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/). To generate yourself
documentation, install doxygen and then run from the
toplevel folder:

```
doxygen
```

Automatically generated Doxygen documentation for the `master` branch
should be available at [codedocs.xyz/measurement-kit/measurement-kit/](
https://codedocs.xyz/measurement-kit/measurement-kit/).
